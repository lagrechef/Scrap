# Data Scraping Project

This project aims to gather data on players from various websites, including Wikipedia, to assist club recruiters in making informed decisions.
Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following packages installed:

    BeautifulSoup
    Pandas
    Requests

You can install these packages by running the following command:

pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas requests

# Scraping Data

The script for scraping data is located in the main.ipynb file. This script uses the BeautifulSoup package to parse the HTML of the websites and extract the relevant information on players. The scraped data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file.
Customizing Data Scraping

You can customize the data that is scraped by modifying the script in the main.ipynb file. For example, you can change the websites that are being scraped or the specific information that is being extracted.
Running the Script


This will start the scraping process and save the data to the players.csv file in the root directory of the project.
Conclusion

With this tool, Club recruiters will be able to gather data on players from multiple sources in an efficient and automated way, allowing them to make more informed decisions about which players to recruit.
